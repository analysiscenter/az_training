Task_11
Plan

1 scenario. 
Make 14 ouptputs, 2*2 for edges coordinates and 10 for classification. Loss  = CE + MSE(coordinates). Requires a lot of augmented data and a lot of maxpulling (large convolutions) and skipconnctions from early layers to the output.
2. scenario.
Make an intermidiate output with trainable loss for detecting 4 coordinates. This coordinates somehow interact with another classification
