* task_01 - using dataset and tensorflow libraries write logistic, linear and poisson regressions.
* task_02 - Create CNN for recognition MNIST imgaes with parallel augmentation.
* task_03 - Write CNN (with batch_norm, dropout, changing learning rate) for recognition MNIST images with augmentation and early stopping.
* task_04 - Git-notebooks including:
  - git branch, git checkout, git stash, git log, git show
  - git merge, git mergetool, git reset, git rebase
* task_06 - Compare ResNet with FreezeOut method and without.
* task_07 - Experiments with weights.
* task_08 - Experiments on ResNet.
