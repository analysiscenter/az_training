* task_01 - using dataset and tensorflow libraries write logistic, linear and poisson regressions.
* task_02 - Create CNN for recognition MNIST imgaes with parallel augmentation.
* task_03 - Write CNN (with batch_norm, dropout, changing learning rate) for recognition MNIST images with augmentation and early stopping.
* task_04 - Git-notebooks including:
  - git branch, git checkout, git stash, git log, git show
  - git merge, git mergetool, git reset, git rebase
* task_06 - Compare ResNet with FreezeOut method and without.
* task_07 - Experiments with weights:
  - Testing how many weights we can nullify without loss of quality.
  - Ð¡lusters weightss and check, how many clasters need to model, for predict without loss of quality.
* task_08 - Build different ResNet varians:
  - Compare simple ResNet vs ResNet with Bottleneck blocks.
  - Compare ResNet with Bottleneck blocks and Stochastic ResNet.
  * task_09 - Implementation of squeeze and excitation block on ResNet blocks.
  * task_10 - implementation of architectures such as:
  - VGG
  - Inception-v1 or GoogLeNet
  - Unet
  - SSD
  * task_11 - Specific NN, which recognize two numbers in the image and their colors.
